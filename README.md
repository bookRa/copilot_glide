# GLIDE App with Copilot

So, I read a [cool article about a new text2image model released by OpenAI](https://www.marktechpost.com/2021/12/29/openai-introduces-glide-model-for-photorealistic-image-generation/).

I decided to implement a simple webapp that would allow me to talk to a personal AIrtist.

**\* Also took the opportunity to test-drive [GitHub's Copilot AI Code completion](https://copilot.github.com/)... Spoiler Alert: It didn't take long to impress me.** 

On the data engineering side of things, I want to store my prompt, the model's suggestions, and the piece I actually select.

Idea for further improvement: By taking the prompt, model options, and final selection, I could potentially fine-tune the model to generate exactly the types of images I want.
